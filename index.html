  <h1>Capycount Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 17, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Capycount ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the Capycount mobile application (the "App").</p>
  <p>By using our App, you agree to the collection, storage, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. All data you enter into the App, specifically birthday information, is stored exclusively on your local device in the App's private, sandboxed container provided by the operating system. This data is necessary for the core functionality of the App, which is to track and count down to birthdays.</p>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>The data you provide is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers. We rely on the security features of your mobile operating system to protect the information stored within the App's sandbox. Please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect your data.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>The data you enter remains on your device for as long as you use the App and keep the data entries. You have full control over your data and can delete any or all of your birthday entries at any time from within the App. If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data associated with it will be deleted.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:meditasyonlar@gmail.com">meditasyonlar@gmail.com</a>.</p>
