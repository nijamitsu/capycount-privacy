    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>What is Capycount?</h3>
        <p>
          Capycount is a beautifully simple app designed to help you track the
          birthdays that matter most. It provides a clean interface to count
          down the days to a friend's or family member's next birthday, so you
          never miss a chance to celebrate.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I add a new birthday?</h3>
        <p>
          On the main screen, tap the large "+" button. This will open the "Add
          Birthday" screen where you can enter the person's name and their date
          of birth. Tap "Save" to add them to your list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How do I edit or delete a birthday?</h3>
        <p>
          First, tap on a birthday from your main list to go to its detail
          screen. From there, tap the "..." (ellipsis) icon in the top-right
          corner. This will open a menu with options to either "Edit" or
          "Delete" the birthday. Deleting will ask for confirmation before
          removing the entry permanently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Does the app have widgets?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Capycount uses its "Show in Widget" setting to display a
          countdown directly on your Home Screen (via widgets).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What is the "Show in Widget"?</h3>
        <p>
          The "Show in Widget" setting allows you to choose which birthday you
          want to display in the app's Home Screen widget. Since the widget can
          only track one birthday at a time, this setting tells the app which
          one to show.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>How do I set a birthday as "Show in Widget"?</h3>
        <p>
          You can set a "Show in Widget" when you first create it using the
          "Show in Widget" toggle. You can also change it anytime by using the
          "Edit" screen for any birthday and enabling the same toggle. When you
          turn on the "Show in Widget" for a new birthday, the previously
          featured one is automatically un-featured.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>How do notifications work?</h3>
        <p>
          Capycount can remind you on the day of a birthday. In the app's
          "Settings" screen, you can turn notifications on or off. When enabled,
          you can also choose the specific time of day (e.g., 9:00 AM) that
          you'd like to receive all birthday alerts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. All the birthday information you enter is stored securely and
          privately on your device. It is not sent to any external servers or
          cloud services.
        </p>
